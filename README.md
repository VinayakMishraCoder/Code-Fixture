## Introduction
Code-Fixture is a feature-rich mobile application designed for coding enthusiasts. It offers a seamless experience for registering for coding contests, logging in, and managing favorite coding websites. The app is thoughtfully constructed with a strong emphasis on architecture and integration with essential libraries and cloud services.
